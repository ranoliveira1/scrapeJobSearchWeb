# Scrape searching for Regular Expressions
# It's great to search email or number os phone in a web
# For details about regular expression, see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp

# Libraries used
import requests
import re

# SEARCH EMAIL

# These will store the content of the url in the variable "content"
url = 'https://abbisscadres.com/'
content = str(requests.get(url).content)

# This variable store the a regular expression, that'll be a parameter to be used in the search.
# It's very important see the website above to understand how regular expression works
regular_expression_email = "([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)"

# 'findall' is the method from 're' library used to creat a list os all strings that fit the declared regular expression
# 'set' function is used to remove repeated items. As it returns a 'set' object, we use the function 'list' to transform it in a list.
list(set(re.findall(regular_expression_email, content)))

# This is the outcome for the above code:
['info@abbisscadres.com']
